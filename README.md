# About
The goal of this project is to create a set of useful functions for simple Bayesian models. This is primarily in support of a Bayesian statistics course at San Diego State University. By the end of the course, I hope to have functions that calculate prior hyperparameters, generate posterior samples, compute HPD intervals and summary statistics, etc. for most of the models covered.
